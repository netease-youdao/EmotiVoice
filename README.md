**EmotiVoice** is a powerful and modern open-source text-to-speech engine that is available to you at no cost. EmotiVoice speaks both English and Chinese, and with over 2000 different voices (refer to the [List of Voices](https://github.com/netease-youdao/EmotiVoice/wiki/😊-voice-wiki-page) for details). The most prominent feature is **emotional synthesis**, allowing you to create speech with a wide range of emotions, including happy, excited, sad, angry and others.

An easy-to-use web interface is provided. There is also a scripting interface for batch generation of results. 

Here are a few samples that EmotiVoice generates:

## Quickstart

### EmotiVoice Docker image

The easiest way to try EmotiVoice is by running the docker image. You need a machine with a NVidia GPU. If you have not done so, set up NVidia container toolkit by following the instructions for [Linux](https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_22.04&p=nvidia&f=2) or [Windows WSL2](https://github.com/nyp-sit/it3103/blob/main/nvidia-docker-wsl2.md). Then EmotiVoice can be run with,

```sh
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:8501:8501 syq163/emoti-voice:latest
```
The Docker image was updated on January 4th, 2024. If you have an older version, please update it by running the following commands:
```sh
docker pull syq163/emoti-voice:latest
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:8501:8501 -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 syq163/emoti-voice:latest
```
Now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to start using EmotiVoice's powerful TTS capabilities.

Starting from this version, the 'OpenAI-compatible-TTS API' is now accessible via http://localhost:8000/.

### Full installation

```sh
conda create -n EmotiVoice python=3.8 -y
conda activate EmotiVoice
pip install torch torchaudio
pip install numpy numba scipy transformers soundfile yacs g2p_en jieba pypinyin pypinyin_dict
python -m nltk.downloader "averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng"
```

### Prepare model files

We recommend that users refer to the wiki page [How to download the pretrained model files](https://github.com/netease-youdao/EmotiVoice/wiki/Pretrained-models) if they encounter any issues.

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/WangZeJun/simbert-base-chinese WangZeJun/simbert-base-chinese
```
or, you can run:
```sh
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/syq163/WangZeJun.git
```

### Inference

1. You can download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y6Xwj_GG9ulsAonca_unSGbJ4lxbNymM?usp=sharing) by simply running the following command:
```sh
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/syq163/outputs.git
```
2. The inference text format is `<speaker>|<style_prompt/emotion_prompt/content>|<phoneme>|<content>`. 

  - inference text example: `8051|Happy|<sos/eos> [IH0] [M] [AA1] [T] engsp4 [V] [OY1] [S] engsp4 [AH0] engsp1 [M] [AH1] [L] [T] [IY0] engsp4 [V] [OY1] [S] engsp1 [AE1] [N] [D] engsp1 [P] [R] [AA1] [M] [P] [T] engsp4 [K] [AH0] [N] [T] [R] [OW1] [L] [D] engsp1 [T] [IY1] engsp4 [T] [IY1] engsp4 [EH1] [S] engsp1 [EH1] [N] [JH] [AH0] [N] . <sos/eos>|Emoti-Voice - a Multi-Voice and Prompt-Controlled T-T-S Engine`.
4. You can get phonemes by `python frontend.py data/my_text.txt > data/my_text_for_tts.txt`.

5. Then run:
```sh
TEXT=data/inference/text
python inference_am_vocoder_joint.py \
--logdir prompt_tts_open_source_joint \
--config_folder config/joint \
--checkpoint g_00140000 \
--test_file $TEXT
```
the synthesized speech is under `outputs/prompt_tts_open_source_joint/test_audio`.

1. Or if you just want to use the interactive TTS demo page, run:
```sh
pip install streamlit
streamlit run demo_page.py
```

### OpenAI-compatible-TTS API

Thanks to @lewangdev for adding an OpenAI compatible API [#60](../../issues/60). To set it up, use the following command:

```sh
pip install fastapi pydub uvicorn[standard] pyrubberband
uvicorn openaiapi:app --reload
```

## Training

[Voice Cloning with your personal data](https://github.com/netease-youdao/EmotiVoice/wiki/Voice-Cloning-with-your-personal-data) has been released on December 13th, 2023.


## Training a new language model

Training a new language model involves a considerable amount of resources, including computing power, time, and a large, diverse dataset. If you're interested in training a new language model, particularly using OpenAI's GPT-3 architecture, here are the general steps and considerations:

## Access to GPT Codebase:

OpenAI has not released the training code for GPT-3, but they have released the codebase for GPT-2. You can find it on OpenAI's GitHub repository.

## Compute Resources:

Training a large language model like GPT-3 requires substantial computational resources, including powerful GPUs or TPUs and large-scale distributed computing.

## Dataset:

The size of your dataset is crucial. GPT-3 was trained on a massive and diverse dataset comprising a significant portion of the internet. The exact size is not disclosed, but it's on the order of hundreds of gigabytes.

## Data Preprocessing:

You'll need to preprocess your dataset, tokenizing and formatting it appropriately for training. GPT models often use byte-pair encoding or other tokenization techniques.

## Training Parameters:

Configuring training parameters, such as the number of layers, hidden units, and other hyperparameters, is a crucial step. These choices can impact the model's performance and training time.

## Training Time:

Training large language models takes a substantial amount of time. GPT-3 was trained for weeks on powerful hardware. The exact duration will depend on the size of your model and the dataset.

## Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:

After the initial training, you may need to evaluate your model's performance and fine-tune it on specific tasks or domains if necessary.

## Ethical Considerations:

Ensure that your use of the language model aligns with ethical standards, and be aware of potential biases in your training data.

Remember that training a model like GPT-3 requires significant expertise in machine learning, access to substantial computational resources, and the ability to handle large datasets. If you don't have these resources, consider exploring pre-trained models or collaborating with research institutions that specialize in natural language processing.

## Roadmap & Future work

- Our future plan can be found in the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) file.
- The current implementation focuses on emotion/style control by prompts. It uses only pitch, speed, energy, and emotion as style factors, and does not use gender. But it is not complicated to change it to style/timbre control.
- Suggestions are welcome. You can file issues or [@ydopensource](https://twitter.com/YDopensource) on twitter.
